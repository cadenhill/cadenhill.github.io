<a-textvalue="The organelle that has littl  sqiggly lines in it is a mitocondria. The function of a mitocondria is to make energy for the cell."></a-text>
<a-textvalue="The big blue organelle in the cell is called a cenral vacuole. The central vacuoles function is to store food and waste."></a-textvalue="></a-text>

<a-textvalue="The organelle that is holding everything in it is called cytoplasm. The  function of cytoplasm  is to hold all of the organelles in the cell."></a-text>
<a-textvalue="The organelle that looks like blue ribbons is called golgi apparatus. The golgi apparatus' function is to package proteins for moving throughtout the cell."></a-text>
<a-textvalue="The organelle that looks like a dark blue oval is called an nucleus. The nucleus' function is to store the DNA."></a-text>
<a-textvalue="The organelle that is inside the nucleus is called a nucleolus. The nucleolus' function is to rewrite ribosomal RNA."></a-text>
<a-textvalue="The organelle that is around the nucleus and looks similar to the golgi apparatus, it is called a endoplasmic retuculum. The main function of the endoplasmic eticulum is to move things through out the cell. "></a-text>
<a-textvalue="The organelle that looks like little dots in the cell is called a ribosome. A ribosomes' function is to make the proteins for the cell."></a-text>
<a-textvalue="The  organelle that is shaped a little pill with more volume its called lysosome. The main function of a lysosome is to eat the waste and things that are not needed in the cell."></a-text>
<a-textvalue="The organelle that is dark green on the outside and looks likes walls it is called cell wall. The main function of it is to shape and protect the cell."></a-text>
